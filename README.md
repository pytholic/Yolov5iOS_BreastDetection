# Description
**YOLO** is an object detection network. It can detect multiple objects in an image/video and puts `bounding boxes` around these objects. This project is for breast detection during surgery using **YOLOv5** model on **iOS**. The main goal of the project is to perform inference using `.coreml` model and displaying the result (*bounding boxes, labels and confidence*) on the video feed in real-time.

# Steps

## Setting up environment
Create a project in **Xcode** on your **MacOS**. Create a new `Resource` group and plave your `coreml` model inside it. That is all the setup you need to begin.
